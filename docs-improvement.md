### Docs: Enhance contribution guidance in "What is Fumadocs"

This PR enhances the contribution guidance within the "What is Fumadocs" documentation page.

A new sentence has been added to the "Minimal" section, directing potential contributors to the `contributing.md` file for more detailed information on how to contribute to the project.

This small update aims to make it easier for new contributors to find relevant information about getting involved with Fumadocs development.
