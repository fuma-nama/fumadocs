description: How does Fumadocs different from other existing frameworks
---

<Callout type="info">This is for testing Fumadocs MDX Remote</Callout>

## Philosophy

Fumadocs, unlike the other frameworks, it expects you to write code and cooperate with other parts of your software.
While most frameworks are configured with a configuration file, they are usually lack of flexibility when you attempted to complete something more advanced.
You can't control how they render the page, neither the internal logic.

**Fumadocs has no magic:** It gives you the utilities and a good-looking user interface.
You are still using the features of Next.js App Router, configuring Static Site Generation same as a normal Next.js application.
There is nothing new for Next.js developers, you can use it with confidence.

For instance, in this docs, all index pages are rendered dynamically.
Feel free to take a look at the source code of this documentation.

**Opinionated on UI:** The only thing Fumadocs UI offers is **User Interface**, it is opinionated on UI for the best mobile responsibility and user experience.
The design is regularly updated, and we are welcome for feedback about the UI.

## Nextra

Fumadocs is highly inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in Fumadocs.

**However, it is not a drop-in replacement for Nextra.**

While we both support a lot of
advanced usages, Nextra is more opinionated than Fumadocs. Fumadocs is accelerated by App Router. As a result, It provides many server-side functions and you have to
configure things manually compared to simply editing a configuration file.

Fumadocs works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features with plugins and custom themes.

### Better DX

Since Fumadocs is built on the top of Next.js, you'll have to start the Next.js dev
server everytime to review changes. And boilerplate code is relatively more
compared to Docusaurus. For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice
if you don't need any Next.js specific functionality.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things with plugins. Although the flexibility of Fumadocs is high, their
eco-system is larger and maintained by many contributors.

### When to use Fumadocs?

For most of the web applications, vanilla React.js is no longer enough.
Nowadays, we also wish to have a blog, a showcase page, a FAQ page, etc. With a
fancy UI that's breathtaking, in these cases, Fumadocs can help you build the
docs easier, with less boilerplate.

## We are working forward

More and more advanced features are rolling out. We currently support
multiple searching solutions including Algolia Search. A good UI and user
experience is always our priority, welcome to give us feedback via Github
discussions!
