## Overview

We are pleased to announce the release of Fumadocs v16, a significant update that introduces breaking changes designed to refine our API surface, improve compatibility with Vite frameworks, and boost overall performance.

## Major Changes

Fumadocs 16 removed substantial amount of deprecated APIs accumulated since v15.2 Vite support.

- **Removal of the Sidebar API**: The `fumadocs-core/sidebar` module has been deprecated and removed. For sidebar implementations, we recommend adopting pre-built solutions from Shadcn UI.

- **Restructuring of Server-Side Exports**: Exports from `fumadocs-core/server` have been redistributed to more specialized modules:
  - `getGithubLastEdit` -> `fumadocs-core/content/github`.
  - `getTableOfContents` -> `fumadocs-core/content/toc`.
  - `PageTree` and related utilities -> `fumadocs-core/page-tree`.
  - `TOCItemType` and `TableOfContents` -> `fumadocs-core/toc`.
  - removed `createMetadataImage` API, use Next.js Metadata API instead.

- **Default Switch to Shiki's JavaScript Regex Engine**: To ensure seamless compatibility with environments like Cloudflare Workers, the JavaScript engine is now the default over the WASM-based Oniguruma. This change affects `rehype-code` (via the `engine` option) and `fumadocs-core/highlight`.

- **Minimum React.js Version Raised to 19.2.0**: React 19.2 brings crucial performance improvements to Fumadocs UI.
  - **Next.js Projects**: Next.js projects using Fumadocs UI must use Next.js 16 or later, as Next.js uses its own canary channel for React.js.

- `fumadocs-ui/page`:
  - Removed `<DocsCategory />`.
  - Removed the `breadcrumbs.full` option in `<DocsPage />`.
- `fumadocs-core/search/algolia`: The `document` option is renamed to `indexName`.
- `fumadocs-core/search`: Removed the deprecated `createFromSource()` signature in `useSearch()`.
- `fumadocs-core/highlight`: Removed `withPrerenderScript` and `loading` options from `useShiki()`.
- `fumadocs-core/i18n`: Removed `createI18nMiddleware` (import from `fumadocs-core/i18n/middleware` instead).
- `fumadocs-core/source`:
  - Removed `transformers`, `pageTree.attach*` options in `loader()`.
  - Removed the `page.file` property.
  - Removed internal utilities `FileInfo` and `parseFilePath`.

- **Migration to Orama Cloud's New SDK**: The `@orama/core` package replaces the prior client. Update your synchronization code as follows:

  ```ts
  import { sync } from 'fumadocs-core/search/orama-cloud';
  import { OramaCloud } from '@orama/core';

  // [!code highlight:4]
  const orama = new OramaCloud({
    projectId: '<project id>',
    apiKey: '<private api key>',
  });

  await sync(orama, {
    index: '<data source id>',
    documents: records,
  });
  ```

  Refer to the [Orama Cloud documentation](https://docs.orama.com/docs/cloud/data-sources/rest-APIs/official-SDK/introduction) for further details.

### Styling Changes

Fumadocs UI has included some aggressive styling changes that you should know about.

- The default `--fd-layout-width` CSS variable is set to `1600px` for optimal content scaling.
  You can override it if needed.

  ```css
  :root {
    --fd-layout-width: 100vw;
  }
  ```

## Fumadocs MDX 13

Fumadocs MDX refined its API surface for better cross-framework compatibility and flexibility.

### Plugins API

We introduced Plugins API, enabling extensible modifications to MDX configurations without bundler-specific code—ideal for file generation (e.g., types, indexes) or config alterations.

There's a `json-schema` plugin natively provided by Fumadocs MDX.

```ts title="source.config.ts"
import jsonSchema from 'fumadocs-mdx/plugins/json-schema';
import { defineConfig, defineDocs } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const docs = defineDocs({
  dir: 'content/docs',
});

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [jsonSchema()],
});
```

### Bug Fixes

- `remark-include`: fix Markdown stringify logics.
- `postprocess.includeMDAST` support.
- (Vite) support `useContent` on client loader for lint avoidance.

### Next.js

`createMDXSource` and `resolveFiles` are now relocated to `fumadocs-mdx/runtime/next`.

This should not affect majority of projects, as `docs.toFumadocsSource()` is now the preferred way.

### Vite

The `source.generated.ts` file is now moved to `.source/index.ts`, you are recommended to import the `.source` folder (with a path alias).

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      // [!code ++]
      "@/.source": [".source"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Migrate:**

- run dev server/typegen to generate a `.source` folder.
- import it over the original `source.generated.ts`

  .
- note that both docs and `create-fumadocs-app` are updated to `.source` folder.

We also supported index file generation targeting other runtimes like Bun/Node.js.

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import mdx from 'fumadocs-mdx/vite';
import * as MdxConfig from './source.config';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mdx(MdxConfig, {
      generateIndexFile: {
        runtime: 'node',
      },
    }),
    // ...
  ],
});
```

## Fumadocs OpenAPI 9.6

A redesigned schema UI emphasizes client-side rendering (CSR) for recursive components, reducing bundle sizes and enhancing performance in complex JSON schemas.

Non-required fields now include a reset button, with support for `content.showExampleInFields`.
