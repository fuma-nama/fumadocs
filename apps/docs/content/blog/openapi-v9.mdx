## Overview

This breaking change is mainly made to address problems of `generateFiles()` function.

Previously, it was a simple function to generate multiple MDX files/pages from your OpenAPI schema, same as every docs generator.
We tested it on public OpenAPI schemas such as Unkey, Vercel and examples from Scalar and Swagger's Museum schema.

Since these schemas were written for different docs solutions, or even their custom ones.
We made `generateFiles()` too complicated to be capable of producing best results for various schema styles, and it's even harder to customise the generated file paths of API docs.

This update also include:

- Better UI for schema & playground body input
- Improved type-safety for `generateFiles()`

## Breaking Changes

The algorithm for generating file paths is changed:

- `meta.json` will no longer be generated, add as your wanted.
- `per: operation`: The generated path will be identical to your operation id. If not defined, it takes your endpoint path instead.

### Group By

The behaviour of `groupBy` API is also changed.

| value | output                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| tag   | `{tag}/{operationId ?? endpoint_path}.mdx`             |
| route | `{endpoint_path}/{method}.mdx` (ignores `name` option) |
| none  | `{operationId ?? endpoint_path}.mdx` (default)         |

### Customise Output

The usage of `name` option is renewed, it can be used to customise the output path of files.

```ts
import { generateFiles } from 'fumadocs-openapi';

void generateFiles({
  name: (output, document) => {
    // page info
    console.log(output);
    // parsed OpenAPI schema
    console.log(document);
    return 'my-dir/filename';
  },
});
```

## Migration

You can start using the latest algorithm, or keep the current behaviour with:

```ts
import { generateFiles } from 'fumadocs-openapi';

void generateFiles({
  name: {
    algorithm: 'v1',
  },
});
```

Note that it won't create `meta.json` anymore even with `algorithm` set to `v1`, you can keep your current generated `meta.json` files.
