import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

## Overview

The purpose of v15 is mainly to support Tailwind CSS v4.
Tailwind CSS v4 is a complete redesign of its API and internals, to fully adhere the new CSS-first config style, a breaking change is required.

Fumadocs v15 has no other significant changes than migrating the config to Tailwind CSS v4.

## Breaking Changes

Before making the switch, upgrade your site to Tailwind CSS v4 following their [upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide).
You can remove the unused `tailwind.config.js` file and fully rely on the new CSS-first config.

Add `@import` to the presets exported by Fumadocs UI, and include `fumadocs-ui` package into source.

```css title="Tailwind CSS"
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import 'fumadocs-ui/css/neutral.css';
@import 'fumadocs-ui/css/preset.css';

/* relative to the CSS file, make sure it's correct for your app */
@source '../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
```

Since v15, you will no longer pass options in JavaScript to customise plugins.
Instead, you can use the new alternatives in Tailwind CSS v4.

### `addGlobalColors: true`

Forward the colors again:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: var(--color-fd-primary);
  /* same for other colors */
}
```

### CSS Variables

Fumadocs no longer use `--fd-<color>` like `--fd-primary: 0 0% 0%` for colors, it directly defines and uses colors in `@theme`.
Instead of the previous format, it uses `hsl()`:

```css
@theme {
  --color-fd-primary: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Steps

Previous Tailwind CSS utilities like `steps` & `steps` are renamed to `fd-steps` and `fd-step` to avoid conflicts.

### Typography

Typography utilities including `prose`, `prose-*` modifiers will continue to work. Please report problems if they are no longer working or have unexpected change in behaviours.

## Improvements

v15 also included some minor improvements to the UI and OpenAPI integration.

### Code Block Tabs

In the past, you need to write the `<Tabs />` manually when separating code blocks into tabs.

````mdx
<Tabs items={["Tab 1", "Tab 2"]}>

```ts tab="Tab 1"
console.log('Hello World');
```

```ts tab="Tab 2"
console.log('Hello World');
```

</Tabs>
````

Now you can do:

````mdx
```ts tab="Tab 1"
console.log('Hello World');
```

```ts tab="Tab 2"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

Note that the previous usage still works for those who want to customise or pass props to the `<Tabs />` component.

### Reversed Items in `meta.json`

The rest item `...` in the `pages` property of `meta.json` now supports reversed order:

```json
{
  "pages": ["z...a"]
}
```

### OpenAPI Playground

v15 improved the playground UI (inspired by the minimalism of Scalar), and brought Scalar API Client support to Fumadocs OpenAPI.

You can enable the Scalar API Client using `useScalar` option in `createOpenAPI()`:

```ts
import { createOpenAPI } from 'fumadocs-openapi/server';

export const openapi = createOpenAPI({
  useScalar: true,
});
```

And install & configure their `@scalar/api-client-react`:

```package-install
@scalar/api-client-react
```

```css title="global.css"
@import '@scalar/api-client-react/style.css' layer(base);
```

<Callout>
  Be careful that you must configure Tailwind CSS first, using the pre-built
  stylesheet of Fumadocs UI will conflict with their `style.css` because both
  libraries use Tailwind CSS for styling.
</Callout>

## Future Plans

This update should be a simple migration for most developers updating to Tailwind CSS v4.

In the future, we also want to make further improvements to Fumadocs MDX:

- remove `transform` API - you can easily do the same with `.map()` on runtime like:

```ts
import { blog } from "@/.source"

export const updatedBlog = blog.map(...)
```

- remove Manifest API - it was designed to export search indexes, but now it's recommended to implement using route handlers.

- Mention more about our [MDX Remote](/docs/headless/custom-source#mdx-remote) package, it will be the primary solution to handle large docs sites with performance needs that bundler couldn't do, including lazy compilation of MDX files.
