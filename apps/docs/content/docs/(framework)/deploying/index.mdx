description: Deploy your Fumadocs app
---

## Overview

Your Fumadocs app is powered by the underlying React framework (e.g. Next.js), you will need to check the relevant docs of your React framework for deployment guides.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/deploying)
- [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/hosting)
- [Waku](https://waku.gg/#deployment)

If you are looking to host the app as a SPA app (fully static, hostable on CDN), see [Static Build](/docs/deploying/static).

There's some extra notes on specific combinations:

### Next.js + Cloudflare

Use https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare, Fumadocs doesn't work on Edge runtime.

### Next.js + Docker

If you want to deploy your Fumadocs app using Docker with **Fumadocs MDX configured**, make sure to add the `source.config.ts` file and your `next.config.js` file to the `WORKDIR` in the Dockerfile.
The following snippet is taken from the official [Next.js Dockerfile Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile):

```zsh title="Dockerfile"
# syntax=docker.io/docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
# Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager [!code highlight]
COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* .npmrc* source.config.ts next.config.* ./
RUN \
  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \
  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \
  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then corepack enable pnpm && pnpm i --frozen-lockfile; \
  else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
  fi


# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

RUN \
  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn run build; \
  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm run build; \
  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then corepack enable pnpm && pnpm run build; \
  else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
  fi

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT=3000

# server.js is created by next build from the standalone output
# https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

This ensures Fumadocs MDX can access your configuration file during builds.
