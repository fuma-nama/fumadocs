import { story } from './index';

<story.WithControl />

## Introduction

You can use Fumadocs Story to display & document components.
It is a simple, docs-focused alternative of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), it is mainly designed for component libraries.

If you are new to the concept of Story, this is a short explanation from **Storybook** docs:

<blockquote>
  A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. It's an object with annotations that
  describe the component's behavior and appearance given a set of arguments.
</blockquote>

<Callout title="When to use it over Storybook?">

Fumadocs Story is not a replacement for Storybook, we still recommend Storybook for proper UI testing.

</Callout>

## Installation

Follow the installation guide according to your setup:

## Configurations

### Variants

You can provide multiple variants of the component with `args`:

```ts
import { defineStory } from '@/lib/story';
import { Callout } from '@/components/callout';

export const story = defineStory(import.meta.url, {
  Component: Callout,
  args: [
    {
      variant: 'Default',
      initial: {
        title: 'This is a Callout',
      },
    },
    {
      variant: 'Warning',
      initial: {
        title: 'This is a Callout',
      },
      // fixed values for props
      fixed: {
        type: 'warning',
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `controls`

You can further customise on how the controls are generated:

```tsx
import { defineStory } from '@fumadocs/story';
import { GraphView } from '@/components/graph-view';

export const story = defineStory(import.meta.url, {
  Component: GraphView,
  args: {
    // specify the control nodes
    controls: {
      node: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: [],
      },
    },

    // or customise the generated controls
    controls: {
      transform: (node) => node,
    },
  },
});
```
