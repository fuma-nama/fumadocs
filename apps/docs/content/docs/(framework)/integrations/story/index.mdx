## Introduction

You can use Fumadocs Story to display & document components.
It is a simple, docs-focused alternative of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), it is mainly designed for component libraries.

<Callout title="When to use it over Storybook?">

Fumadocs Story is not a replacement for Storybook, we still recommend Storybook for proper UI testing.

## Installation

```npm
npm i @fumadocs/story
```

Add the Tailwind CSS preset.

```css title="Tailwind CSS"
/* [!code ++] */
@import '@fumadocs/story/css/preset.css';
```

### Create a Story

If you are new to the concept of Story, this is a short explanation from **Storybook** docs:

<blockquote>
  A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. It's an object with annotations that
  describe the component's behavior and appearance given a set of arguments.
</blockquote>

To create a story in Fumadocs Story:

```tsx title="graph-view.story.tsx"
import { defineStory } from '@fumadocs/story';
import { GraphView } from '@/components/graph-view';

export const story = await defineStory(import.meta.url, {
  Component: GraphView,
});
```

- Fill the `Component` option to your component, the passed component must be a client component.

<story.WithControl />
