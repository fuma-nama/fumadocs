## Introduction

For a custom content source implementation, there's two ways:

### Using Loader API

Loader API has a file-system-like interface for integrating different content sources.

See [Loader API `source`](/docs/headless/source-api/source) for details.

### Using Low-Level API

For more robust control, you can use lower level APIs directly.

#### 1. Page Tree

You can either hardcode the page tree, or write some code to generate one.
See [Definitions of Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

Pass your page tree to `DocsLayout` (usually in a `layout.tsx`):

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'fumadocs-ui/layouts/docs';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout
      // [!code ++:5]
      tree={
        {
          // your own tree
        }
      }
    >
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

The page tree is like a smarter "sidebar items", they will be referenced everywhere in the UI for navigation elements, such as the page footer.

#### 2. Page Content

For docs page, it's the same logic:

- Define path params (`slugs`).
- Fetch page content from path params.
- Render the content (inside the `DocsPage` component).

You may need table of contents, which can be generated on your own, or using the [`getTableOfContents`](/docs/headless/utils/get-toc) utility (Markdown/MDX only).

```tsx
import { DocsPage, DocsBody } from 'fumadocs-ui/layouts/docs/page';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  if (!page) notFound();

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={page.tableOfContents}>
      <DocsBody>{page.render()}</DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Pre-rendering

The mechanism for pre-rendering differs depending on your React.js framework.

It's important to pre-render pages (especially the frequently visited ones) to improve initial load time.

<Callout title='In Next.js'>

Define the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) function to populate dynamic & catch-all routes.

</Callout>

When pre-rendering pages from a remote source, make sure to optimize repeated reads during the build phase.
For example, if you're fetching content via GitHub API, it is better to clone the repository content locally for pre-rendering.

```text tab="Before"
/docs/* -> GET github.com
/docs/introduction -> GET github.com
/docs/my-page -> GET github.com
Error: API Ratelimit
```

```text tab="After"
start -> git clone
/docs/* -> ls
/docs/introduction -> read file
/docs/my-page -> read file
```

#### 4. Document Search

This can be difficult considering your content may not be necessarily Markdown/MDX.
For Markdown and MDX, the built-in [Search API](/docs/headless/search/orama) + search index usage is adequate for most use cases.
Otherwise, you will have to bring your own implementation.

We recommend 3rd party solutions like Orama or Algolia Search. They are more flexible than the built-in Search API, and is easier to integrate with remote sources.
Fumadocs offers a variant of [Search Integrations](/docs/headless/search).
