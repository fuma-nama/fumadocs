## Setup

1. Integrate [Mixedbread Search](/docs/headless/search/mixedbread).

2. Create a search dialog component.

   <include meta='title="components/search.tsx"'>./mixedbread.tsx</include>

<include>.shared.mdx</include>

### Tag Filter

Optionally, you can add UI for filtering results by tags. Configure [Tag Filter](/docs/headless/search/mixedbread#tag-filter) on search server and add the following:

<include>.tag-filter.mdx</include>
