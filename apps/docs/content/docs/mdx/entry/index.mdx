## Overview

After defining collections in your config file, collection entries are compiled into JavaScript files that your app can access.

While the compilation will be done by Fumadocs MDX's bundler/runtime plugins, it also generates **entry files** to access the collection outputs.

### Entry Files

Collection outputs will be generated under the output directory, you can access them from entry files.

<Files>
  <Folder name=".source" defaultOpen>
    <File name="server.ts" />
    <File name="browser.ts" />
    <File name="dynamic.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

See below for a list of available ways to access outputs.
