description: Generate types without running dev/build server

### Overview

You can run `fumadocs-mdx` to generate types & index file (e.g. the `.source` folder in Next.js).

Optionally, you can run it in post install to ensure types are generated when initializing the project.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "fumadocs-mdx"
  }
}
```

If your project uses a custom configuration file or you want to output the generated files to a different directory, you can provide these paths directly as command-line arguments:

```npm
npx fumadocs-mdx <config-path> <output-dir>
```
<config-path>: Path to your custom Fumadocs MDX configuration file (e.g. lib/fumadocs/source.config.ts).
<output-dir>: Directory where the generated files should be written (lib/fumadocs/.source).
