### Overview

You can run `fumadocs-mdx` to generate types & index file (e.g. the `.source` folder in Next.js).

Optionally, you can run it in post install to ensure types are generated when initializing the project.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "fumadocs-mdx"
  }
}
```
