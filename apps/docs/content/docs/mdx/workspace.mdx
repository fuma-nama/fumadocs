## Overview

**Workspace** in Fumadocs MDX, refers to an independent project with its own config and content.

<Files>
  <Folder name="my-workspace" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="content/docs" defaultOpen>
      <File name="index.mdx" />
      <File name="test.mdx" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="source.config.ts" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="content/docs" defaultOpen>
    <File name="welcome.mdx" />
  </Folder>
  <File name="source.config.ts" />
</Files>

<Callout title="Good to Know">
  Fumadocs MDX Workspace is not limited to the traditional meaning of workspace
  in package managers.

They do not need to have its own `package.json`, only a config file is needed.

</Callout>

To define a workspace, add:

```ts title="source.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export default defineConfig({
  workspaces: {
    'my-workspace': {
      dir: 'my-workspace',
      config: await import('./my-workspace/source.config.ts'),
    },
  },
});
```

When writing content in a workspace, note that:

- `cwd` refers to the **current workspace directory**.
- configs will not inherit, workspaces are always independent.

By running dev or build server, you should see collection entries from all workspaces to be generated.

### Accessing Collections

You can access the generated files of a workspace at `.source/{workspace}/*`. For example:

```ts title="lib/source.ts"
import { docs } from 'fumadocs-mdx:collections/my-workspace/server';
```

> The output location of root workspace is not changed.

To integrate multiple sources in Fumadocs, use [`multiple`](/docs/headless/source-api/source#multiple-sources):

```ts title="lib/source.ts"
import { loader, multiple } from 'fumadocs-core/source';
import { docs } from 'fumadocs-mdx:collections/server';
import * as MyWorkspace from 'fumadocs-mdx:collections/my-workspace/server';

export const source = loader(
  multiple({
    root: docs.toFumadocsSource(),
    'my-workspace': MyWorkspace.docs.toFumadocsSource(),
  }),
  {
    baseUrl: '/docs',
  },
);
```

## When to Use

In some setups, you might have multiple Fumadocs MDX configs with their own content directory.

With workspaces, you can integrate them into one Fumadocs MDX config, and access all collections of each workspace.

This is crucial for use cases like storing content across multiple repos, a simplified setup would be:

- let your main docs repo be $A$, and other repos be $T_n$
- for each repo $T_n$:
  - $T_n$ has $A$ as a git submodule.
  - $T_n$ defines its own config `source.config.ts` and work independently.
  - when a commit is made to the content in $T_n$, it triggers a GitHub action (or CI), which creates a new deployment on $A$.
- when a deployment is triggered on $A$:
  - Fumadocs MDX handles each $T_n$ as a workspace.
  - each workspace generates its own collection entries, e.g. `fumadocs-mdx:collections/{repo}/server`.
  - Fumadocs `loader()` integrate multiple sources into one.
