## Usage

### Markdown

To display content from another Markdown/MDX file, specify its path relative to the file itself in the `<include>` tag.

```mdx title="page.mdx"
<include>./another.mdx</include>
```

<Callout>
  For Markdown files, you don't need to escape for MDX syntax but note that
  you'll need `rehypeRaw` for HTML comments & content.
</Callout>

### CodeBlock

For other types of files, it will become a codeblock:

```mdx title="page.mdx"
<include>./script.ts</include>

<include lang="md" meta='title="lib.md"'>
  page.md
</include>
```

### `cwd`

Resolve relative paths from cwd instead of the Markdown file:

```mdx
<include cwd lang="tsx" meta='title="lib.ts"'>
  ./script.ts
</include>
```

### Section

For Markdown files, you can include a section of it:

```mdx title="a.mdx"
## Hello World

<section id="test">This is included</section>

This is not included.
```

```mdx title="b.mdx"
<include>a.mdx#test</include>
```

Or with heading id:

```mdx title="a.mdx"
## Included Section

I'm here!

## Not Included

Some random text.
```

```mdx title="b.mdx"
<include>a.mdx#included-section</include>
```
