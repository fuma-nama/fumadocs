## Introduction

**Fumadocs is very flexible.** You can integrate with any content source, even without an official adapter.

### Examples

You can see examples to use Fumadocs with a CMS, which allows a nice experience on publishing content, and real-time update without re-building the app.

- [BaseHub](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-basehub)
- [Sanity](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-sanity)
- [Payload CMS](https://github.com/MFarabi619/fumadocs-payloadcms)

For a custom content source implementation, you will need:

### Page Tree

You can either hardcode the page tree, or write some code to generate one.
See [Definitions of Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

Pass your page tree to `DocsLayout` (usually in a `layout.tsx`):

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'fumadocs-ui/layouts/docs';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout
      // [!code ++:5]
      tree={
        {
          // your own tree
        }
      }
    >
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

The page tree is like a smarter "sidebar items", they will be referenced everywhere in the UI for navigation elements, such as the page footer.

### Docs Page

For docs page, it's the same logic:

- Define path params (`slugs`).
- Fetch page content from path params.
- Render the content.

#### Body

In the main body of page, find the corresponding page according to the slug and render its content inside the `DocsPage` component.

You also need table of contents, which can be generated with your own implementation, or using the [`getTableOfContents`](/docs/headless/utils/get-toc) utility (Markdown/MDX only).

```tsx
import { DocsPage, DocsBody } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  if (!page) notFound();

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={page.tableOfContents}>
      <DocsBody>{page.render()}</DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

### Pre-rendering

The mechanism for pre-rendering differs depending on your React.js framework.

It's important to pre-render pages (especially the frequently visited ones) to improve initial load time.

<Callout title='In Next.js'>

Define the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) function to populate dynamic & catch-all routes.

</Callout>

When pre-rendering pages from a remote source, make sure to optimize repeated reads during the build phase.
For example, if you're fetching content via GitHub API, it is better to clone the repository content locally for pre-rendering.

```text tab="Before"
/docs/* -> GET github.com
/docs/introduction -> GET github.com
/docs/my-page -> GET github.com
Error: API Ratelimit
```

```text tab="After"
start -> git clone
/docs/* -> ls
/docs/introduction -> read file
/docs/my-page -> read file
```

### Document Search

This can be difficult considering your content may not be necessarily Markdown/MDX.
For Markdown and MDX, the built-in [Search API](/docs/headless/search/orama) is adequate for most use cases.
Otherwise, you will have to bring your own implementation.

We recommend 3rd party solutions like Orama or Algolia Search. They are more flexible than the built-in Search API, and is easier to integrate with remote sources.
Fumadocs offers a simple [Algolia Search Adapter](/docs/headless/search/algolia), which includes a search client to integrate with Fumadocs UI.

## MDX Remote

Fumadocs offers the **MDX Remote** package, it is a helper to integrate Markdown-based content sources with Fumadocs.
You can think it as a `next-mdx-remote` with built-in plugins for Fumadocs.

### Setup

```package-install
@fumadocs/mdx-remote
```

The main feature it offers is the MDX Compiler, it can compile MDX content to JSX nodes.
Since it doesn't use a bundler, there's some limitations:

- No imports and exports in MDX files.

It's compatible with Server Components. For example:

```tsx
import { createCompiler } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';
import { DocsBody, DocsPage } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';
import { getMDXComponents } from '@/mdx-components';

const compiler = createCompiler({
  // options
});

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: { slug?: string[] };
}) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  const compiled = await compiler.compile({
    source: page.content,
  });

  const MdxContent = compiled.body;

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={compiled.toc}>
      <DocsBody>
        <MdxContent components={getMDXComponents()} />
      </DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

### Images

On serverless platforms like Vercel, the original `public` folder (including static assets like images) will be removed after production build.
The MDX compiler might no longer be able to access local images in `public`.

When referencing images, make sure to use a URL.
