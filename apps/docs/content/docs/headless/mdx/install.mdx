title: Package Install
description: Generate code blocks for installing packages
---

## Usage

Add the plugin to `remarkPlugins`.

```ts
import { remarkInstall } from 'fumadocs-core/mdx-plugins'

const config = {
    remarkPlugins: [
      [remarkInstall, { ... }]
    ],
}
```

Create code blocks with `package-install` as language.

````mdx
```package-install
my-package
```
````

The following structure should be generated by the plugin. Please define and
import the components into the MDX document.

```mdx
<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab value="npm">...</Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">...</Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">...</Tab>
<Tabs>
```

```package-install
my-package
```
