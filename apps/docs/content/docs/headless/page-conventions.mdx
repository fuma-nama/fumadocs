import { File, Files, Folder } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

## Overview

This is a shared convention for organizing your pages, followed by all file-system based content sources including Fumadocs MDX.

## File

A [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) or Markdown file.

### Frontmatter

By default, it includes:

- `title`
- `description`
- `icon`

You may extend your content source to add additional properties.

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Best document ever
---

## Folder

Organize multiple pages. If not specified, folder name will be used as the display name.

Pages are sorted alphabetically, except for `index.mdx` which is always ordered at the top.

Use [meta file](#meta) to customise a folder.

### Open by Default

Force to open the folder by default.

```json title="meta.json"
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "defaultOpen": true
}
```

### Multiple Page Trees

Adding a `root` property in meta can mark your folder as a **root**.
The nearest root of the current page will be shown on all navigation elements.

In other words, when you are in a root folder called "core", the other folders are not shown on the sidebar.

<Files>
  <Folder name="core" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Current Page" className="!text-primary !bg-primary/10" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Not shown on sidebar" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

To allow users switching between page trees, you can implement a page tree switch. On Fumadocs UI, it is available via [`<RootToggle />`](/docs/ui/components/root-toggle).

```json title="meta.json"
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "root": true
}
```

## Meta

Customize the display name, order of pages, or its items on the sidebar by
creating a `meta.json` in the folder.

When a meta file presents, items are not included unless you have explicitly add them to `pages`.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "components"]
}
```

> `pages` are the filenames of file

### Path

The items of `pages` property can be a relative path to a page or folder. File extensions are not required.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["../headless/page"]
}
```

### Separator

You can define a separator in meta by adding a item surrounded with
`---`.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["---Separator---"]
}
```

### Rest

Tired to specify the order of every single page in `meta.json`? You can use
`...` to automatically add and sort remaining items.

<Callout title="Note" className="mb-4">
  Index pages won't be included, you must specify the order of `index`.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "..."]
}
```

### Extract

You can extract the items from a folder with `...folder_name`.

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "...folder"]
}
```

### Link

Use the syntax `[Text](url)` to insert links.

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["index", "[Vercel](https://vercel.com)"]
}
```

## Icons

Add custom icons for a page or a folder with the `icon`
property.

Pass the icon name as a string, and handle it with [Source API](/docs/headless/source-api#icons) or other ways.

```mdx
---
title: My Page
icon: MyIcon
---
```

```json
{
  "title": "My Folder",
  "icon": "MyIcon"
}
```

## Internationalization

You can create a localized page for specific language by adding `.{locale}` to your file name. Pages can't be language-specific, you must create a page for default
locale in order to have its localized version.

This works for meta files too, you can add `.{locale}` to the file name like `meta.cn.json`.

> If it's the default language, just leave it empty like `get-started.mdx`. Do
> not use add locale code to file name.

### Example

Assume your default language is `en`.

| Name              |                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| file.mdx          | Correct                                   |
| file.cn.mdx       | Correct                                   |
| file.en.mdx       | Default locale doesn't need a locale code |
| components.cn.mdx | Pages can't be language-specific          |
