description: Use Next Docs with ContentLayer
---

Next Docs has native support for Contentlayer.

## Setup

1. Install `rehype-pretty-code remark-gfm rehype-slug rehype-img-size`.

2. Copy the code from
   [Example Configuration](https://github.com/SonMooSans/next-docs/blob/main/packages/next-docs-ui/src/contentlayer/index.ts).

3. Edit your configuration.

```ts title="contentlayer.config.ts"
// copied code...

export default makeSource(defaultConfig)
```

4. Build the [Page Tree](/docs#build-page-tree).

```ts
import { allDocs, allMeta } from 'contentlayer/generated'
import { buildPageTree } from 'next-docs-zeta/contentlayer'

// load pages
const ctx = loadContext(allMeta, allDocs)
export const tree = buildPageTree(ctx)
```

## Pages Structure

All files are located in `/content` and `/content/docs` for documentation pages.

### File

By default, it uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and supports `title` and
`description` frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Best document ever
---

```

You may edit the configuration file to add additional properties.

### Folder

You can use folders to organize multiple pages, the uppercased name of the
folder will be used as the display name.

### Meta

You can also customize the folder name, the order of pages, or adding a
separator by creating a `meta.json` in the folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "---Separator---", "components"] // file name of pages
}
```

### Separator

As you see, you can define a separator in meta by adding a item surrounded by
`---`.
