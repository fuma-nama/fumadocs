import Banner from '@/public/banner.png';

Contentlayer integration supports the built-in `next/image` component by passing `width`
and `height` property automatically. You can enjoy the benefits of Next.js Image
Optimization without extra configurations.

Under the hood, It gets the image size using `rehype-img-size`, then display it
via `next/image`.

## Usage

You doesn't need to enable it.

### Example

Assume the image is under the `/public` folder.

```mdx
![banner](/banner.png)
```

<Image alt="Banner" src={Banner} />
