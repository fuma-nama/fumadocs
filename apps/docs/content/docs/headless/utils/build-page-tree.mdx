title: Page Tree Builder
description: Build Page Tree with File System or your own content source
---

## Usage

Create a builder instance, and pass your pages and meta files as options.

```ts
import { createPageTreeBuilder } from 'next-docs-zeta/server'

const builder = createPageTreeBuilder({
  metas,
  pages
})

const pageTree = builder.build()
```

### Multiple Trees

You can build multiple trees with the same builder instance.

```ts
builder.build({ root: 'docs/ui' })
builder.build({ root: 'docs/headless' })
```

### Internationalization

You can also build internationalized page tree with the `buildI18n` method, it
returns a language-to-page-tree map.

```ts
builder.buildI18n({ languages })
```

## Pages Structure

Shared conventions for structuring your pages.

### File

By default, it uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and supports `title` and
`description` frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Best document ever
---

```

You may edit the configuration file to add additional properties.

### Folder

You can use folders to organize multiple pages, the uppercased name of the
folder will be used as the display name.

### Meta

You can also customize the folder name, order of pages, or adding a separator by
creating a `meta.json` in the folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "---Separator---", "components"] // file name of pages
}
```

> By default, pages are sorted by `String.localeCompare{:js}`.

### Separator

As you see, you can define a separator in meta by adding a item surrounded by
`---`.

### Rest

Tired to specify the order of every single page in `meta.json`? You can use
`...` to automatically add and sort remaining items.

<Callout title="Note" className="mb-4">
  Index pages won't be included, you must specify the order of `index`.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "---Separator---", "..."]
}
```

### Extract

You can extract the items from a folder with `...folder_name`.

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "...folder"]
}
```

### Icons

It is supported to have custom icons for a page or a folder. Add an `icon`
property to the frontmatter or `meta.json`, and configure icon handler via
`resolveIcon` option.

```mdx
---
title: My Page
icon: MyIcon
---
```

```ts
createPageTreeBuilder({
  resolveIcon: icon => {
    // load icon from library
    const res = require('lucide-react')
    icon = icon.trim()

    if (res[icon]) return createElement(res[icon])
    return undefined
  }
})
```

### With Locale

You can create a page for specific language by adding `.{locale}` to your MDX
file name. Pages can't be language-specific, you must create a page for default
locale in order to have its localized version.

For meta files, you have to add `-{locale}` to the file name instead (e.g.
`meta-cn.json`).

> If it's the default language, just leave it empty like `get-started.mdx`. Do
> not use add locale code to file name.

Assume your default language is `en`.
