[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com), and
[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev) (or any CMS).

## Setup

### Choose a Source

Next Docs has native support for [Next MDX](/docs/mdx) and ContentLayer, but any kind of formats and
sources are allowed.

You can refer to this [guide](/docs/headless/contentlayer) to learn how to
use Contentlayer with Next Docs.

### Build Page Tree

A page tree refers to structured data of all pages.

```js
export const tree = [
  {
    type: 'page',
    name: 'Quick Start',
    url: '/docs',
  },
  {
    type: 'separator',
    name: 'Guides',
  },
  {
    type: 'page',
    name: 'Example',
    url: '/docs/example',
  },
];
```

You can generate the tree using our Contentlayer adapter, or end up with
writing your own.

### Create MDX file

Create `/content/docs/index.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Quick Start
description: My cool docs
---

Hello World
```
