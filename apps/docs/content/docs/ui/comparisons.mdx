How does Next Docs UI different from other existing frameworks? It is a
frequently asked question and here's an answer.

## Is it a Nextra Clone?

Someone asked me this question on Discord, it is a fact that it's highly
inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in Next Docs if you're using Contentlayer.

But Next Docs is not a clone of Nextra. While Nextra is more opinionated and
supporting a lot of advanced usages, Next Docs is less opinionated and it's
built for App Router. As a result, It provides many server-side functions but
you have to configure things manually.

Next Docs UI works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

### The Core Model

Although Next Docs strongly rely on other libraries, the model of Next Docs is a
backend library + frontend framework, it accepts different sources and gives you
a great looking UI.

The only reasion I build Next Docs is that I used to look for an alternative to
Nextra that allows me to fully customise the UI. I came up with Next Docs Zeta,
a headless ui library. Next Docs UI laterly released as an example of Next Docs
Zeta.
