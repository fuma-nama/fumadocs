How does Next Docs UI different from other existing frameworks? It is a
frequently asked question and here's an answer.

## Is it a Nextra Clone?

Someone asked me this question on Discord, it is a fact that it's highly
inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in Next Docs if you're using Contentlayer.

However, Next Docs is not a clone of Nextra. While we both support a lot of
advanced usages, Nextra is more opinionated but Next Docs isn't. It is built for
App Router. As a result, It provides many server-side functions and you have to
configure things manually compared by simply editing a configuration file.

Next Docs UI works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

### The Core Model

Next Docs also rely on other libraries, the model of Next Docs is a backend
library + frontend framework, it accepts different sources and gives you a great
looking, constant UI.

The only reasion I build Next Docs is that I used to look for an alternative to
Nextra that allows me to fully customise the UI. I came up with Next Docs Zeta,
a headless ui library. Next Docs UI laterly released as an example of Next Docs
Zeta, built on top of Zeta.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features via plugins and custom themes.

### Better DX

Since Next Docs is built on the top of Next.js, you'll have to start Next.js dev
server in order to review changes. And boilerbate code is relatively more
compared to Docusaurus. For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice
if you don't need any Next.js specific functionality.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things that will take you a few hours to setup
manually with plugins. Although the flexiblity of Next Docs is high, their
eco-system is larger and maintained by many contributors.

### When to use Next Docs?

For most of the web applications, vanilla React.js is no longer enough.
Nowadays, we also wish to have a blog, a showcase page, a FAQ page, etc. With a
fancy UI that's breathtaking, in these cases, Next Docs can help you build the
docs easier, with less boilerbate.

## We are working forward

More and more advanced features will be rolling out. We currently support
multiple searching solutions including Algolia Search. A good UI and user
experience is always our priority, welcome to give us some advices via Github
discussions.
