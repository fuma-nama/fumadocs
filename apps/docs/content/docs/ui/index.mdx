**Fumadocs UI** offers a beautifully designed theme for documentation sites.

It is bundled with many interactive components & layouts for docs sites, allowing low maintenance cost of code while receiving regular UI improvements.

You can also use [Fumadocs CLI](/docs/cli) to install the components locally and have full control.
