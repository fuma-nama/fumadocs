## Introduction

Fumadocs <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast and flexible.
It composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router, allowing high code flexibility.

Fumadocs has different parts:

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-purple-300" />} title='Fumadocs Core'>

Handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown extensions.

<Card icon={<PanelsTopLeft className="text-blue-300" />} title='Fumadocs UI'>

The default theme of Fumadocs offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and interactive components.

<Card icon={<Database />} title='Content Source'>

The input/source of your content can be a CMS or local data layers like [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev) and [Fumadocs MDX](/docs/mdx), the official content source.

<Card icon={<Terminal />} title='Fumadocs CLI'>

A command line tool to install UI components and automate things, useful for customizing layouts.

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`.

Node.js 18 or above required, note that Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js production build.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create fumadocs-app
```

</Tabs>

It will initialize a new fumadocs app.
Now you can start hacking!

<Callout title='From Existing Codebase?'>

    You can follow the [Manual Installation](/docs/ui/manual-installation) guide to get started.

</Callout>

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```package-install
npm run dev
```

## Explore

In the project, you can see:

- `lib/source.ts`: Code for content source adapter, Fumadocs uses [`loader()`](/docs/headless/source-api) to interact with your content source, it also assigns a URL to your pages.
- `app/layout.config.tsx`: Shared options for layouts, optional but preferred to keep.
- `app/(home)`: The route group for your landing page and other pages.
- `app/docs`: The documentation layout and pages.
- `app/api/search/route.ts`: The Route Handler for search.

### Customise Content

Content source handles all your content, like compiling Markdown files and validating frontmatter.

- **Fumadocs MDX:** Read the [Introduction](/docs/mdx) to learn how it handles your content,
  and customise different options like frontmatter schema. A `source.config.ts` config file has been included.

- **Custom Source:** Fumadocs is not Markdown-exclusive. For other sources like Sanity, you can [build a custom content source](/docs/headless/custom-source).

### Customise Sidebar

Navigation elements like sidebar take a [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree) to render navigation links, it's a tree that describes all available pages and folders.

Normally, the sidebar items (formally page tree) are generated from your file structure.
You can learn how to customise the page tree from:

### Writing Content

Despite the supported syntax of MDX, Fumadocs has some additional features for authoring content too.
You can refer to:

    description="Learn how to write documents in Fumadocs"
  />
</Cards>

### Customise UI

Since the design system is built on Tailwind CSS, you can [customise colors with CSS Variables](/docs/ui/theme#colors).

Fumadocs UI offers pre-styled layouts and UI components, you can customise components with exposed props like `style` and `className`.
We also provided many options to customise layouts ([See Available Options](/docs/ui/layouts)).

If none of them suits you, Fumadocs CLI is a way to install Fumadocs UI components and layouts to your codebase, similar to Shadcn UI. Allowing you to fully customise with code:

```package-install
@fumadocs/cli --save-dev
```

```bash
pnpm fumadocs add
```

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='fix-monorepo-styling' title="How to fix stylings not being applied in Monorepo?">

Sometimes, `fumadocs-ui` is not installed in the workspace of your Tailwind CSS configuration file. (e.g. a monorepo setup).

You have to ensure the `fumadocs-ui` package is scanned by Tailwind CSS, and give a correct relative path to `@source`.

For example, add `../../` to point to the `node_modules` folder in root workspace.

        ```css
        @import 'tailwindcss';
        @import 'fumadocs-ui/css/neutral.css';
        @import 'fumadocs-ui/css/preset.css';

        /* [!code --] */
        @source '../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
        /* [!code ++] */
        @source '../../../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
        ```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='change-base-url' title="How to change the base route of /docs?">

You can change the base route of docs (e.g. from `/docs/page` to `/info/page`).
Since Fumadocs uses Next.js App Router, you can simply rename the route:

<Files>
  <Folder name="app/docs" defaultOpen className="opacity-50" disabled>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="app/info" defaultOpen>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

And tell Fumadocs to use the new route in `source.ts`:

```ts title="source.ts"
import { createMDXSource } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';
import { docs, meta } from '@/.source';

export const source = loader({
  baseUrl: '/info',
  source: createMDXSource(docs, meta),
});
```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='dynamic-route' title="It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?">

Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

You can enable Static Exports on Next.js to get a static build output. (Notice that Route Handler doesn't work with static export, you have to configure static search)

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='custom-layout-docs-page' title='How to create a page in /docs without docs layout?'>

Same as managing layouts in Next.js App Router, remove the original MDX file from content directory (`/content/docs`).
This ensures duplicated pages will not cause errors.

Now, You can add the page to another route group, which isn't a descendant of docs layout.

For example, under your `app` folder:

<Files>
  <File name="(home)/docs/page.tsx" />
  <Folder name="docs">
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
    <File name="[[...slug]]/page.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

will replace the `/docs` page with your `page.tsx`.

    </Accordion>

</Accordions>
