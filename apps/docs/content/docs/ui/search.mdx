Next Docs UI supports document searching based on Next Docs Zeta and offers the
default search dialog. You can refer to this
[guide](/docs/headless/utils/search) to learn more.

## Search Dialog

You can customise the search dialog from root provider,
[learn more](/docs/ui/blocks/root-provider).

By default, your dialog will be lazy loaded using
[`next/dynamic`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading),
this allows a better initial loading performance.

### Other Solutions

If you want to use other solutions such as Aligo Search or ElasticSearch, you
can replace the default dialog with your own by passing the `SearchDialog`
component to the root provider.

```jsx
<RootProvider
  search={{
    SearchDialog: YourOwnDialog
  }}
>
  ...
</RootProvider>
```
