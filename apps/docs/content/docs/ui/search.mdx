Next Docs UI supports document searching based on Next Docs Zeta and offers the
default search dialog. You can refer to this
[guide](/docs/headless/utils/search) to learn more.

## Search Dialog

You can customize the search dialog from the root provider,
[learn more](/docs/ui/blocks/root-provider).

By default, your dialog will be lazy loaded using
[`next/dynamic`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading),
this allows a better initial loading performance.

### Algolia (Experiemntal)

Next Docs offers first-hand support for [Algolia](https://algolia.com). For
setup guide, see
[Integrate Algolia Search with Next Docs](/docs/headless/utils/algolia-search).

While generally we recommend building your own search with their client-side
SDK, you can use the built-in dialog from
`next-docs-ui/components/dialog/search-algolia`.

To pass your search index, wrap your root provider in the Algolia context
provider.

```tsx title="Client Component"
import algoliasearch from 'algoliasearch/lite'
import Dialog, {
  AlgoliaContextProvider
} from 'next-docs-ui/components/dialog/search-algolia'
import { RootProvider } from 'next-docs-ui/provider'
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'

const client = algoliasearch(...)
const index = client.initIndex('document')

export function Provider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <AlgoliaContextProvider index={index}>
      <RootProvider
        search={{
          SearchDialog: Dialog
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </RootProvider>
    </AlgoliaContextProvider>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** The built-in implementation doesn't use instant search (their
> official javascript client).

### Other Solutions

If you want to use other solutions such as ElasticSearch, you can replace the
default dialog with your own by passing the `SearchDialog` component to the root
provider.

> **Tip:** You shall lazy load the dialog with `next/dynamic`

```jsx
<RootProvider
  search={{
    SearchDialog: YourOwnDialog
  }}
>
  ...
</RootProvider>
```
